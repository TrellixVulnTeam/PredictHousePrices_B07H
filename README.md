## Installation

The following python libraries are used on the project: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I wanted to begin to apply some of the Machine Learning concepts and CRISP-DM process that I'm learning on Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, but in a subject that was interesting to me. Since I work in Real State, the following questions about this market intrigued me:
- How we can get at least 0.90 r² in a model to predict property prices?
- What neighborhoods in São Paulo have the highest squared meter price? And the lowest?
- Rent vs Sale: what is the difference between variables correlation with price?

## File Descriptions

The repository contains the database and the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and findings about the 3 questions above.

## Results

The findings are explained on the Jupyter Notebook and on [this Medium Post](https://juncken-marcos.medium.com/how-can-we-predict-house-prices-with-machine-learning-f26b9432a7aa).
